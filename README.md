# Fwindows XP

Live demo [here](https://fwindows-xp.netlify.app/) ðŸ‘ˆ

(Note: Netlify deployment may be a couple commits behind...)

## What's this?

A bad rip-off of a phenomenal project I saw on /r/learnprogramming called "puter": https://puter.com/

I figured I'd try my hand at recreating this project, though a much much less interactive version of it, in a Windows XP format using only HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

I've found a version of what I'm trying to achieve done in React.js that's [incredible](https://winxp.vercel.app/). If I can do 5% of what this person has built, I'd be pretty ok with it. Mad props to this [guy](https://github.com/ShizukuIchi).

## To do:

A great deal, and not limited to this list. I'm sure I'll add more as I think of other features.

- Completely re-do the Recycle Bin modal

- Develop a more robust "style guide" so I'm not thoughtlessly just slapping in random rem values until components look "somewhat okay"

- Add more "functioning" desktop icons

- Reduce length of CSS files by making some more reusable "helper" classes

- Add more "functioning" items in the start menu

I'm sure that I'll be working on this project for quite some time, so this to-do list as well as the project itself will be a long time in the making. Lots of little green squares incoming (hopefully! :D).
