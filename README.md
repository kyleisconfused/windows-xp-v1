# windows-xp-v1

## What's this?
A bad rip-off of a phenomenal project I saw on /r/learnprogramming called "puter": https://puter.com/

I figured I'd try my hand at recreating this project, though a much much less interactive version of it, in a Windows XP format using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## To do:
A great deal, and not limited to this list. I'm sure I'll add more as I think of other features.

- Develop a more robust "style guide" so I'm not thoughtlessly just slapping in random rem values until components look "somewhat okay"

- Add borders on the taskbar

- Add hover effects to buttons in recycling bin modal window

- Make the start button close when clicking outside of it (except taskbar)

- Make it responsive (herculean task!)

- Add more "functioning" desktop icons

I'm sure that I'll be working on this project for quite some time, so this to-do list as well as the project itself will be a long time in the making. Lots of little green sqares incoming (hopefully! :D).
